XLKit
=====

An iOS/OS X library for creating simple, stupid Excel XML documents (i.e. xlsx). Currently a work in progress.

###Background

 Throughout my career I've encountered many situations where a client/employer has asked for data to be exported into a Simple Stupid Excel file. This is simply my attempt to remedy that problem for both myself and others.
